    <img src="images/ewatto-farm.jpg" alt="Ewatto farmland" class="article-img">
    <p>The farming season in Ewatto community has already kicked off as local farmers begin early land preparation for cassava, yam, and maize. With fertile lands and a communal spirit, farmers are hopeful for a bountiful harvest in 2025.</p>
    <p>Community leaders have urged youths to take advantage of the vast farmland instead of remaining idle in the cities. Many farmers expressed optimism that with good rainfall, Ewatto could record one of its best farming seasons in recent years.</p>
    <p>Observers also noted that early planting could help the community tackle food scarcity in Edo State and boost local trade across Esanland.</p>
