    <p>The farming community of <strong>Ewatto, Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State</strong>, has begun early land clearing and preparation ahead of the 2025 farming season. 
    Farmers in the area say this year’s effort will focus on crops such as cassava, yam, maize, and pepper.</p>

    <p>Speaking with <em>TheVillageGist</em>, a local farmer, Mr. Okojie, explained that many families are returning home from the city to take advantage of the fertile land in Ewatto. 
    “The land is blessed. If we farm together, we can reduce poverty and also supply food to other parts of Edo State,” he said.</p>

    <p>Community leaders have also encouraged youths without jobs in Benin City and Lagos to return home and join farming activities. 
    According to them, farming not only provides food security but also creates income opportunities for the younger generation.</p>

    <p>The Ewatto community has a history of large-scale farming, and with renewed interest from indigenes and support from local cooperatives, 
    this year’s planting season is expected to record a boost in production.</p>

    <p><strong>TheVillageGist</strong> will continue to provide updates on Ewatto and other Esan communities as farming activities progress.</p>
