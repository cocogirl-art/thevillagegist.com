    <p>The Federal Government has reassured Nigerians that measures are underway to cushion the effects of the subsidy removal on petrol. According to officials, the administration is committed to introducing palliative programs, including subsidized transport systems and direct financial support for vulnerable households.</p>

    <p>Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, the Minister of Finance stated that the subsidy removal, though painful, was a necessary step to save Nigeria’s economy from collapse. She further highlighted that negotiations with labor unions were ongoing to ensure fair implementation of palliative measures.</p>

    <p>The government also assured that investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and energy will help reduce the long-term burden on citizens while creating more job opportunities.</p>

    <p>Nigerians are, however, divided on the issue. While some argue that subsidy removal will end decades of corruption in the petroleum sector, others fear the immediate rise in transportation and food prices.</p>

    <p>As discussions continue, citizens are eagerly awaiting the rollout of the government’s promised palliative measures.</p>
